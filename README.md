# Landlock crate

This version is not stable yet.

The [published crate](https://crates.io/crates/landlock) may not be up-to-date because of the ongoing work to design a better [best-effort security API](https://github.com/landlock-lsm/rust-landlock/pull/5).
However, you can still use this repository to experiment with Landlock.

More information about Landlock can be found in the [official website](https://landlock.io).
